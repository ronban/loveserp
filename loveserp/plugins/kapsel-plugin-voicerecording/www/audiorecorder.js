/**
 *
 * AudioRecorder can be used to record audio content into the specified file path. The recording can be paused and resumed.
 * AudioRecorder is also able to play back the current recording, pause the playing and seek for a given position.
 *
 * AudioPlayer is initiated with a file path parameter. AudioRecorder will record the content into this file.
 * If the file exist then AudioRecorder append the audiocontent to the end of the file.
 * <br>
 * AudioRecorder is a javascript wrapper object around platform specific native implementations.
 * <br><br>
 * <h5>States and state transitions</h5>
 * The following diagram depicts the possible states and state transitions of AudioRecorder.
 * <br>
 * <img src="../../doc/AudioRecorderStateChart.png">
 * <br>
 * AudioRecorder has the following states:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Initialized</b> - When the AudioRecorder is initiated and the file on the given path does not exist AudioRecorder's state is <b>Initialized</b>. This case the recording can be started.</li>
 * <li><b>Recording Paused</b> - This state represents that the recording is suspended. AudioRecorder's state become <b>Recording Paused</b> when the current recording is paused or when the AudioRecorder is initiated and the file 
 * is initiated but the file on the given path does exist. In this state the recoring can be continued or the current recording can be played back.</li>
 * <li><b>Recording</b> - This state represents that the recording is in progress. From both <b>Recording Paused</b> and <b>Initialized</b> states the recording can be started 
 * by {@link sap.VoiceRecording.AudioRecorder#startRecord startRecord} method.</li>
 * <li><b>Playing</b> - This state represents that the playing is in progress. When the recording is paused it can be played back by {@link sap.VoiceRecording.AudioRecorder#startPlay startPlay} method.
 * When the player reaches end of the recording, it automatically stops playing and switch the state to <b>Playing Paused</b>. This case playStopped callback in {@link sap.VoiceRecording.AudioRecorder.Options} is invoked.</li>
 * <li><b>Playing Paused</b> - This state represents that the playing is paused on the current position. The playing can be paused by {@link sap.VoiceRecording.AudioRecorder#pause pause}.
 * When it is resumed the playing must continue from the current position.</li>
 * <li><b>Closed</b> - From both <b>Recording Paused</b>, <b>Playing Paused</b> and <b>MaxLength Exceeded - Playing paused</b> states the recording can be finished by {@link sap.VoiceRecording.AudioRecorder#close close}. 
 * After this method the AudioRecorder can not be used. All the methods throw "AudioRecorder is closed" error.</li>
 * <li><b>MaxLength Exceeded - Playing paused</b> - this state represents that the maximum length (if it was specified) is exceeded and the recording can not be continued. 
 * The state of AudioRecorder becomes <b>MaxLength Exceeded - Playing paused</b> in the following cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>From <b>Recording</b> state: the recording was in progress and the max length is exceeded. This case maxLengthExceeded callback specified in {@link sap.VoiceRecording.AudioRecorder.Options} is invoked.</li> 
 * <li>From initialization: when the AudioRecorder is initialized the length of the existing file is checked. If the max length is exceeded, then this state becomes active.</li>
 * <li>From <b>MaxLength Exceeded - Playing</b>: when the max length was exceeded the recording can not be continued, but it can be played back. If the playback is paused then this state becomes active.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li><b>MaxLength Exceeded - Playing</b> - this state represents that the maximum length (if it was specified) is exceeded and the recording is being played back. 
 * This case the play back can be paused which change the state to <b>MaxLength Exceeded - Playing paused</b>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In both <b>Playing</b> and <b>Playing Paused</b> states the current playing position can be modified by {@link sap.VoiceRecording.AudioRecorder#seekPlay seekPlay}.
 * In both <b>Playing Paused</b> and <b>Recording Paused</b> states the {@link sap.VoiceRecording.AudioRecorder#pause pause} can be invoked, but it does nothing.
 * <br>
 * Invoking invalid state transitions on the current AudioRecorder state will cause an "Invalid state transition" error.
 *
 * <h5>Max length</h5>
 * Maximum length can be specified (optionally) in the options parameters. If it is specified the AudioPlayer will check the length of the current recording in the initialization and 
 * in the <b>Recording</b> state.
 * If the current length exceeds the maxLength, the state changes to <b>MaxLength Exceeded - Playing paused</b>. In <b>Recording</b> state the given maxLengthExceeded callback is invoked.
 *
